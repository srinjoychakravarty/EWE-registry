# EWE-registry
The EOSIO smart contract Weakness Enumeration registry is a classification system for weaknesses and vulnerabilities in EOSIO smart contracts.

It is loosely aligned to the terminologies and structure used in the Common Weakness Enumeration ([CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/)) and the Ethereum Smart Contract Weakness Classification ([SWC](https://github.com/SmartContractSecurity/SWC-registry)) Registry whilst paying attention to weakness variants that are specific to EOSIO smart contracts.
